# Unofficial Community Map for Derail Valley
A map to let you see the valley in more detail than the in-game map, featuring speed signage, grade indication, curve radius, etc.

## Current Plans
- [ ] Generally improve the look and UX of the map
- [ ] Add Points of Interest, like Stations, service points, shop locations, and maybe even the potential spawn locations of wrecked demonstrators.
